# **ByBit Hack Prevention Smart Contract**
**Author:** HS
**Repository:** [bybit](https://github.com/dev-nx6984/bybit)  

## **🔒 Overview**
This project implements a **secure smart contract** designed to prevent **ByBit-style hacks**, where attackers manipulate UI and transaction signing. The contract ensures:
- **Only the actual sender** can store transaction hashes.
- **An independent auditor** must verify transactions before execution.
- **Execution is only possible after verification.**
- **Re-execution prevention** ensures no replay attacks.

## **🚀 Features**
✅ **Prevents UI manipulation attacks**  
✅ **Enforces transaction self-ownership**  
✅ **Requires verification before execution**  
✅ **Blocks unauthorized transaction modifications**  
✅ **Ensures transactions cannot be re-executed (Replay Protection)**

## **⚙️ Setup & Installation**
### **🔹 1. Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dev-nx6984/bybit.git
cd bybit
```

### **🔹 2. Install Dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```

### **🔹 3. Configure Hardhat**
If you need to update the Hardhat environment, run:
```bash
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat compile
```

---

## **🛠️ Deployment**
### **🔹 Deploying the Contract Locally**
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```
This will deploy **SecureTransactionGuard** and return the contract address.

### **🔹 Deploying to a Testnet (Goerli, Sepolia)**
Update `hardhat.config.js` with your testnet RPC & deploy:
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network goerli
```

---

## **🧪 Running Tests**
### **🔹 Update Contract Address in Test Scripts**
Before running tests, **ensure that the contract address in `testByBitHackPrevention.js` and `testSecureTransactionGuard.js` matches the deployed contract address**. Update this line:
```javascript
const contractAddress = "YOUR_DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS";
```
Then, proceed with testing:
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/testByBitHackPrevention.js --network localhost
```

✔️ Expected **successful** output:
```
❌ Attempting unauthorized transaction storage...
✅ Attack prevented: Unauthorized storage rejected.

📌 Storing transaction hash...
✅ Transaction hash stored successfully.

❌ Attempting fake verification...
✅ Attack prevented: Unauthorized verification rejected.

❌ Attempting execution of unverified transaction...
✅ Attack prevented: Unverified transaction execution rejected.

❌ Attempting to re-execute a completed transaction...
✅ Attack prevented: Re-execution rejected.
```

## **🔍 How the Smart Contract Prevents ByBit-Style Attacks**
| Attack Type | Status |
|------------|--------|
| **UI Manipulation (Fake Transactions in Frontend)** | ✅ **Prevented** |
| **Transaction Storage by Attackers (Self-Ownership Violation)** | ✅ **Prevented** |
| **Execution of Unverified Transactions** | ✅ **Blocked** |
| **Replay Attack (Re-executing the same transaction)** | ✅ **Blocked** |

---

## **📜 Smart Contract Logic**
### **🔹 `SecureTransactionGuard.sol`**
This contract ensures:
- **Transaction storage is restricted to the sender.**
- **An auditor must verify transactions before execution.**
- **Execution only happens after verification.**
- **Transactions cannot be executed twice (Replay Protection).**

### **🔹 Key Contract Functions**
```solidity
// Store transaction securely
function storeTransactionHash(bytes32 _txHash) external;

// Auditor must verify transactions before execution
function verifyTransaction(address user, bytes32 _txHash) external onlyAuditor;

// Execute only after verification
function executeTransaction(bytes32 _txHash) external nonReentrant;
```

## **📌 Next Steps & Improvements**
🚀 **Move to Testnet:** Deploy on **Goerli, Sepolia, or Polygon Mumbai**  
🛡️ **Audit for Gas Optimizations:** Reduce execution costs  
🔐 **Implement Timelocks:** Delayed transaction execution for added security  
📊 **Monitor Real-World Attacks:** Stay ahead of new exploit techniques
